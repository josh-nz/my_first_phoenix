# MyFirstPhoenix

This is a playground app to learn Elixir and Phoenix, so it's full of random bits. 

Of most interest is an implementation of Tic Tac Toe, which started as a port of the React Tic Tac Toe tutorial. It includes full history and undo, PubSub communication between connected browsers, and a supervision tree to dynamically track individual games.

Plenty is still missing as this is an ongoing, work in progress learning exercise, including any authentication and player turn enforcement.

In the spirit of Joe Armstrong, I'm still in the "make it work" stage. Make it beautiful, both UI and code, will follow as I solidify my learnings, so please don't judge the current state of the code too much.


To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
